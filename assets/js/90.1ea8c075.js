The Arduino™ framework offers a wide range of libraries that are ready to use. For larger projects WisBlock solutions can be created as well with professional IDE’s like the Segger Embedded Studio or Keil.\nWisBlock consists of WisBase, WisCore, WisSensor and WisIO modules.")])]),s._v(" "),e("h2",{attrs:{id:"wisblock-base"}},[e("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#wisblock-base"}},[s._v("#")]),s._v(" WisBlock Base")]),s._v(" "),e("rk-head",{attrs:{img:"/assets/rakwireless/product-categories/WisBlock-Base.svg"}},[e("p",[s._v("WisBlock is build up on a WisBase, a platform carrier that allows easy plug-in of 1 WisCore processing board, 1 WisIO interface board and up to 4 WisSensor boards.
