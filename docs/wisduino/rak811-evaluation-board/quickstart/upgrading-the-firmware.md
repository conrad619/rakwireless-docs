# Upgrading the Firmware

If the firmware version of your RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Board is newer than V3.0.0.0 or you have just burned the bootloader into RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Board according to the [Burning Bootloader into the Device](https://doc.rakwireless.com/rak811-lora---evaluation-board/burning-the-bootloader-into-the-device) document, proceed to **Step 2**.

1. In case you have not just burned the bootloader as instructed in the previous section, you need to manually go into **boot mode**. Connect you board via the USB interface and enter the following **AT command** after you have connected via the proper COM port:

::: tip üìù NOTE
Make sure to choose the correct port in the COM Port field. You can check this in the [Interfacing with RAK 811 Development Board](interfacing-with-rak811.html) document.
:::

```bash
at+set_config=device:boot
```

2. Download the **RAK Upgrade Tool** from the RAKwireless website **[here](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/RAK612-LoRaButton/Tools/RAK%20LoRaButton%20Upgrade%20Tool%20V1.0.zip)**. Then, open the tool. Again don't forget to choose the correct port!

6. Now, **CLOSE** the upgrade tool and **OPEN** the serial port too, again.

7. Choose the correct **COM port** and set the baud rate to **115200**. Then open the serial port and enter the AT command shown below to restart. Another option is to press the **RST** button on the RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Board.

```bash
at+set_config=device:restart
```
