# Burning the Bootloader

You can burn the bootloader on your RAK7200 by following the steps below:

1. Download and Install the [**STM32CubeProgrammer**](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stm32cubeprog.html#overview) Software from STMicroelectronics on your Windows PC.

2. Plug in the provided Micro-USB cable into the RAK7200 LPWAN Tracker and insert it in your PC. We need to set the RAK7200 first to work in **Boot Mode.** Refer to Figure 2 below and do the following: Hold down the BOOT0 Button, then press the Reset Button for a couple of seconds. Release the Reset and the BOOT0 Button.

3. Open the STM32CubeProgrammer Software and Select UART type.

- Choose the appropriate port number in the **COM Port** field. Open the [Interfacing with RAK7200](interfacing-with-rak7200.html) document to check the appropritate COM Port to be used for the demonstration.
- Set the Baud Rate to 115200, and the Parity to Even as seen in **Figure 3** then Press **Connect.**

If you didn't properly set your RAK7200 device to work in BOOT Mode, you will see the following information in the Log Section of the Software:

- If this happens, go back to the section above and set your RAK7200 device to work in **Boot Mode** again.
- If all works well, you will then see the following log:

4. Now that you have successfully connected your RAK7200 to the STM32CubeProgrammer Tool, let's burn the Bootloader into the RAK7200.

- Download the Bootloader for the RAK7200 LPWAN Tracker [**here**](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/RAK7200-Tracker/Firmware/).
- In the STM32CubeProgrammer, Click the "**Erase Chip**" button to erase all the data on RAK7200:
