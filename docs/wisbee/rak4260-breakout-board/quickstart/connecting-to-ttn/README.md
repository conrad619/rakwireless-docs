## Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

The Things Network is about enabling low power devices to be used in long range gateways that connect to an open-source, decentralized network and exchange data with Applications. Learn more about [**The Things Network**](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

In this section, we will be connecting the RAK4260 LPWAN Breakout Module to The Things Network (TTN). If you don't have an account yet, head on to [https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create an account. Once done, log in to your account and in the home page, go to the console. Refer to figure 1.

Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

1. **Application ID** - this will be the unique id of your application in the Network. Note that the characters should be in lower case, no spaces are allowed.
2. **Description** - this is a short and concise human readable description of your application.
3. **Application EUI** - this will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience.
4. **Handler Registration** - the handler you want to register this application to.

After filling in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**". If the page is the same as figure 5 then, you have successfully registered your application.

Here are the things that you should take note in registering your device:

1. **Device ID** - this is the unique identifier for your RAK4260 LPWAN Breakout Module in your application. You need to enter this manually.
2. **Device EUI** - this is the unique identifier for your device in the network. You can change it later, if you want.
3. **App Key** – this key will be used to secure the communication between the device and the network.
4. **App EUI**– a unique identifier of the Application that you are registering the device within.

Populate the **Device ID** and **Device EUI**_ (generate a random one by pressing the arrows)_ fields and leave the rest as is. Click “**Register**”.

In the Device Overview, there are two options of the **Activation Method**: **OTTA** and **ABP**. Take note that the default option is **OTAA** as shown in figure 8. However, instructions will be provided on both methods in the following sections starting with OTAA.
