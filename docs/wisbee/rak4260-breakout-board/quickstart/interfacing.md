- Go to your Device Manager by pressing: **Windows + R** and typing **devmgmt.msc**, or search in the Start Menu.
- Look for Ports (**COM & LPT**) and find the name **USB-SERIAL CH340** and take note of the COM Port Number as you will need it to connect with the board.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Windows 10 should recognize the board and automatically install drivers, however, if it is missing in the COM & LP ports list you need to manually install the CH340 Drivers.
