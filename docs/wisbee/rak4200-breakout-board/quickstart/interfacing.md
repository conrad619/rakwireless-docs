- Go to your Device Manager by pressing: Windows + R and typing devmgmt.msc or search in the Start Menu.

Windows 10 should recognize the board and automatically install drivers, however if it is missing in the COM & LP ports list you need to manually install the CH340 Drivers.
:::

- Look for Ports (COM & LPT) and Find the name USB-SERIAL CH340 and take note of the COM Port Number as you will need it to connect with the board. You might have another model number but the wording ‚ÄúUSB-SERIAL‚Äù should be present in some form.
