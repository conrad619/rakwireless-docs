1. After connecting the device and choosing the appropriate COM Port and Baudrate, press the "**Reset button**" on your RAK5005 Baseboard Module and If everything works perfectly, you should see the following message below:

/>

2. As you see, RAK4260 has joined with TTN successfully. The default join mode is OTAA, and the default frequency is EU868. After resetting it, RAK4260 will join automatically because the dev_eui, app_eui, and app_key have been configured in the source code.

```C
