# Burning the Firmware

**RAK4260**  is an LPWAN Module based on Microchip‚Äôs SIP and the firmware for the RAK4260 can also use the provided SDK of Microchip.

RAK has already compiled a Demo firmware for RAK4260 based on Microchip's SDK that can be downloaded freely for testing purposes in this Github Repository: 
* [https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK4260-LoRaNode-demo](https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK4260-LoRaNode-demo)

:::tip üìù NOTE
This sample firmware is solely for testing purposes only. If you want to use and deploy your own, you have to make your own customized firmware based on Microchip SDK.
