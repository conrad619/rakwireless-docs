::: tip üìù NOTE
In order to have an optimal antenna matching for the Low and High LoRa¬Æ bands there are two types of modules with different hardware. The L type module only works for the 433MHz and 470MHz LoRa¬Æ bands. The H type module is for the 868MHz to 923MHz (the rest of the spectrum). Note that the hardware is specific for your selected band and can't be changed.
