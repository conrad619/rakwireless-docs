# Checking Device Logs

There are 2 ways that you can check the logs for debugging purposes on your RAK4600 LPWAN Evaluation Board:

1. **Through J-Link RTT Viewer**
2. **Through UART**

## Through J-Link RTT Viewer

1. If you want to check the logs of RAK4600 LPWAN Evaluation Board using this method, make sure you have connected the RAK4600 LPWAN Evaluation Board with your PC through JTAG like the following diagram below:

2. Go to the Official Website of **Segger** where you can Download the [J-Flash software](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/tools/j-flash/about-j-flash/). Open the program ‚Äú**J-Link RTT Viewer V6.60f**‚Äù and choose "**USB**" for the type of connection to J-Link. After which, press "**OK**".

:::tip üìù NOTE
If there is no log after connecting successfully, you can try to reset RAK4600 or double check the connection of JTAG.

## Through UART

1. If you want to check the log of RAK4600 through UART, you should make sure that RAK4600 has been connected with your PC through UART correctly as the following picture shows:

2. Open the RAK Serial Port Tool as described in [Interfacing with RAK4600](README.md)

3. Press the Reset Button on the RAK4600 LPWAN Evaluation Board then you will see the following contents in the Serial port Tool.
