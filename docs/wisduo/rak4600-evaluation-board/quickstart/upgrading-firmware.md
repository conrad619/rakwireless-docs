# Upgrading Firmware through DFU using BLE
1. Download the DFU package of the RAK4600 LPWAN Evaluation Board [**here**](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/RAK4600/Firmware/DFU-Package/RAK4600_V3.0.0.7_dfu.zip) and save it on your mobile phone.

2. Make sure the Bluetooth on your mobile is turned on. Open the **nRF Connect** Mobile application and you will see all BLE devices in range in the scan list:

3. Press the reset button on the RAK4600 and wait for a couple of seconds. Look for a BLE Device named "RUI-..." in the scan list of the app. Connect to this device and click "**Nordic UART Service**"

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 This will be only visible for 60 seconds. More information about Bluetooth Connection Guide can be found here in [here](bluetooth-connection-modes)

9. After connecting, select the DFU Icon. Select the **Distribution packet (ZIP)** and press OK. This will then prompt you to select the zip file of the firmware that you have downloaded.

10. It will then automatically start to upgrade the firmware of your RAK4600 through DFU over BLE. After upgrading, it will restart and the DFU Connection will be disconnected. Now you can use your RAK4600 with the latest firmware!
