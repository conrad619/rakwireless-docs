# Configuring your Gateway

## Packet Forwarder Set-up

1. In the Web Management Platform, navigate through **LoRa¬Æ Network > Network Settings > Packet Forwarder Settings > General Setup**, and set the Protocol in the drop-down list to **Semtech UDP GWMP Protocol**. You only need to change the Server Address to forward the traffic to your ChirpStack running on the Ubuntu Instance (AWS). Enter your Instance Public IP Address in the field marked with the red rectangle in the image below:

:::tip üìù NOTE
Read the [LoRa Network](/knowledge-hub/resources/user-manual/web-management-platform/lora-network.html#_1-network-settings) section in the Web Management Platform to know more about the other modes aside from the Packet Forwarder Setup.

4. Assuming you entered the parameters correctly you should see your Gateway status as seen is a few second in the Gateway Details tab. You can also monitor Live LoRa Frames in the tab with the same name to see incoming traffic.

## MQTT Bridge Set-up

If you want to use the MQTT Bridge to forward your LoRa¬Æ Traffic to your LoRa¬Æ Network Server, you need to configure your Gateway use the Bridge instead of the Packet Forwarder. 

1. Navigating through **LoRa¬Æ Network-> Network Settings-> Packet Forwarder Settings-> General Setup**, set the Protocol in the drop-down list to **LoRa¬Æ Gateway MQTT Bridge**. Then, click "**Save and Apply**".

2. Next, choose the type of LoRa Network Server you are going to be using.

3. Set the address to the address of the AWS Instance and the **port to 1883**, **Save and Apply**.

4. Lastly, register your Gateway to Chirpstack if you have not done so. You can follow the steps undergone in the Packet Forwarder Set-up section of the [**Configuring your Gateway**](/knowledge-hub/resources/user-manual/web-management-platform/lora-network.html#packet-forwarder) document.
