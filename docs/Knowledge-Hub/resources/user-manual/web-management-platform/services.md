## 1. Dynamic DNS (Beta)

Dynamic DNS allows your router to be reached via a fixed host name while having a dynamically changing IP address.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Make sure to go through the **Hints** in order to get some understanding of how Dynamic DNS functions as a whole. You can do this by clicking on the "**Show more**" text in the Hints field.

### Overview

To change the global settings press on the text "**To change global settings click here**" that is marked in the red rectangle in Figure 1. This will affect DDNS as a whole (both IPv4 and IPv6 for example).

If you want to have separate settings/rules for IPv4/IPv6, you need to define two sets, one for each. You can do this by filling in a name in the text box and pressing the ‚Äú**Add**‚Äù button.

An IPv4 example is created by default and you only need to configure its parameters by pressing the ‚Äú**Edit**‚Äù button. Refer to the [DDNS/VPN Document](/Knowledge-Hub/resources/deployment-guide/) for a practical example on how to configure this feature.

## 2. OpenVPN Tunnels

This is where you can create and new tunnels and monitor existing ones. You can check the available options in the image below:
