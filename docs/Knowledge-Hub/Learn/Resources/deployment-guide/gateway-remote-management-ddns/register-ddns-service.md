# Register a DDNS Service

In using Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS), you can assign a Domain name that you link to your Gateway‚Äôs Real IP Address. This allows you to access your Gateway with a Domain name that is static and will not change even if a new IP address is assigned to the Gateway, making sure you don‚Äôt have to keep a lengthy list of address that needs to be constantly updated. The DDNS service takes care of this for you.

## Choosing your DDNS Provider

A list of providers supported by the RAK Industrial Gateway series can be found below.

::: tip üìù NOTE
For this sample demonstration, the dyndnss.net DDNS service provider shall be used.
