### 4. Backup / Flash Firmware

There are a number of actions that this portion of the Firmware allows the user to perform. It is recommended you make regular backups and refresh the firmware when there is a new release in order to assure optimal performance.

- **Generate archive**: Downloads an archive of the current configuration
- **Perform reset**: Resets the Gateway to the default settings
- **Restore**: You can upload a previously generated archive to restore the configuration settings at the time of its making
- **Flash new firmware**: Update the firmware by flashing a bin file. Use the button to select the location of the new firmware file and the blue button to initiate the flashing process. There is a tick box to toggle the option of keeping the current settings of the gateway


:::tip üìù NOTE
"The **Keep Settings** check box is selected by default, as unchecking it will results in having a Gateway with stock settings after the firmware update."

### 5. Reboot

Reboots the gateway. All unsaved changes will be discarded. This is not a reset in any way and only power cycles the device. All configuration settings will be left intact.
