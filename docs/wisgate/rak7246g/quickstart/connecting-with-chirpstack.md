# Connect the Gateway with Chirpstack

The ChirpStack or previously known as LoRaServer project provides open-source components for building LoRaWAN¬Æ networks. You can learn more about ChirpStack [here](https://www.chirpstack.io/).

## Using an Independent ChirpStack
Since the RAK7246G LPWAN Developer Gateway does not include a built-in Chirpstack, choose in the ways provided below so you can get an independent ChirpStack:
1. Use RAK's Cloud TestingChirpStack - If you want to use RAK's Cloud Testing ChirpStack, contact RAK's Technical Support in the Forum: [RAK Free Cloud Server for Testing](https://forum.rakwireless.com/t/rak-free-cloud-loraserver-for-testing/344)
2. Setup an Independent ChirpStack by yourself.

This is a lot more complicated having to deploy a remote ChirpStack by yourself but Chirpstack provided a detailed guide on how to do it [here](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/):

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING
  Remember to run the `sudo gateway-config` command in the CLI and point the Gateway to the IP address of the machine you just installed Chirpstack on. This can be done in item 2 in the menu "**Setup RAK Gateway LoRa¬Æ concentrator**"!
:::

Assuming you have set it up correctly, Login to your ChirpStack to register your Gateway by opening the ChirpStack's web page in a browser by entering "**IP Address of ChirpStack:8080**".

* If you are using an Independent Chirpstack, use the IP Address you have set in the Configuring the Gateway document. 
* If you are using the RAK Free Cloud Server Chirpstack `209.250.251.9`

* The default username is "**admin**" and the password is also "**admin**"

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 If you are using the RAK Cloud Testing ChirpStack, input the account and password you have asked in the forum provided beforehand.

* Fill in the Gateway ID that we got from the last section ([Configuring the Gateway](/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/configuring-the-gateway.html)), also called Gateway EUI.

* If you have properly configured your Gateway and there is a network connection between the external ChirpStack and your Gateway, you should see the following page and status:

<rk-img src="/assets/images/wisgate/rak7246g/quickstart/chirpstack_success.png" width="100%" figure-number = "7" caption=" Successfully Registered the Gateway"/>

* By clicking the Live LORAWAN¬Æ FRAMES tab, you can check the LoRa¬Æ packets sent by the nodes into your RAK7246G LPWAN Developer Gateway

**Congratulations!** :tada: You have connected your Gateway to an external ChirpStack Successfully!
