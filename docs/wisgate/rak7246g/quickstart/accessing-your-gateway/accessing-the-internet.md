# Accessing the Internet

Assuming you have successfully logged into your Gateway using SSH, enter the following command in the command line:

```bash
sudo gateway-config
```

You will now then see a page like the following picture below

<rk-img src="/assets/images/quick-start-guide/rak7246/config-options.png" width="100%" figure-number  = "1" caption="Configuration Options for the Gateway"/>

1. **Set pi password** - used to set/change the password of the gateway.
2. **Set up RAK Gateway LoRa¬Æ Concentrator** - used to configure the frequency, which the gateway will operate on, and the LoRaWAN¬Æ Server which the gateway will work with.
3. **Restart packet -forwarder** - used to restart the LoRa¬Æ packet forwarded process.
4. **Edit packet-forwarder config**- used to open the global_conf.json file, in order to edit LoRaWAN¬Æ parameters manually.
5. **Configure Wifi** - used to configure the Wi-Fi settings in order to connect to a network.

## Connect through Wi-Fi

If you want to connect through Wi-Fi, it can easily be done with the Wireless capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Zero W by choosing "**5 Configure WIFI**". By default, the RAK7246G LPWAN Developer Gateway works in Wi-Fi AP Mode. In order for the Gateway to connect to the router, it must work in Wi-Fi Client Mode.

<rk-img src="/assets/images/quick-start-guide/rak7246/config-wifi.png" width="100%" figure-number  = "2" caption="Configuration options for WIFI"/>

There are 5 options to choose from in the Wi-Fi configuration menu:

1. **Enable AP Mode/Disable Client Mode** - the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi Access Point Mode after rebooting while the Wi-Fi Client Mode will be disabled (this is the default mode).
2. **Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode** - the Gateway will work in Wi-Fi Client mode after rebooting, while Wi-FI AP Mode will be disabled.
3. **Modify SSID and pwd for AP Mode** - used to modify the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi AP. Only works if the Wi-Fi AP Mode is enabled.
4. **Add New SSID for Client** - this is used if you want to connect to a new Wi-Fi Network. Only works in Wi-Fi Client mode.
5. **Change Wi-Fi Country** - this is used to modify the Resident Country to match with Wi-Fi standards.

::: tip üìù NOTE:
In order to enable Wi-Fi Client Mode, you have to disable first the Wi-Fi AP Mode
:::

Once Wi-Fi AP Mode has been disabled by choosing "**2 Enable Client Mode/Disable AP Mode**", you can now then connect to a new Wi-Fi Network by choosing "**4 Add New SSID for Client**":

<rk-img src="/assets/images/quick-start-guide/rak7246/add_ssid.png" width="100%" figure-number  = "3" caption="Add a New SSID"/>

- Start by selecting your country of residence:

<rk-img src="/assets/images/quick-start-guide/rak7246/country_residence.png" width="100%" figure-number  = "4" caption="Selecting Country of Residence"/>

- Enter the SSID of the network you want to connect:

::: warning
Please ensure to input the correct Wi-Fi SSID and Password or you will not be able to connect to the RAK7246G again via SSH in Wi-Fi AP Mode. If stuck in this situation, please follow [this](#optional-configurations) procedure listed in the Accessing the Internet document which is applicable for all Raspberry Pi based gateways to work again in Wi-Fi AP mode.

<rk-img src="/assets/images/quick-start-guide/rak7246/ssid_new.png" width="100%" figure-number  = "5" caption="SSID of the Network you want to connect to."/>

- Enter also the password. Just leave it empty if None.

<rk-img src="/assets/images/quick-start-guide/rak7246/password.png" width="100%" figure-number  = "6" caption="Password of the Wi-Fi"/>

- Lastly, reboot the gateway using the command `sudo reboot` in the command line and it will connect to the router successfully.

```sh
sudo reboot
```

## Optional Configurations

These configurations under this section are only optional and situational.

### Reverting Back to Wi-Fi AP Mode

In the event that you have entered either or both incorrect Wi-Fi SSID and Password in the Wi-Fi Client Mode setup for the RAK7246G LPWAN Developer Gateway to connect to the router, follow these set of steps for you to work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode and redo the setup.

- Remove the SD Card from your RAK7246G LPWAN Developer Gateway and insert it into your PC. Your PC should be able to detect it same with the image below:

<rk-img src="/assets/images/quick-start-guide/rak7246/rak_ap.png" width="50%" figure-number  = "7" caption="Creating rak_ap file to your SD Card"/>

- Using your "Command Prompt" or "Terminal", navigate to your SD Card and type this command to generate the "rak_ap" file.

```
cd > rak_ap
```

- Check if the rak_ap file is created successfully. If so, re-insert the SD Card into your RAK7246G LPWAN Developer Gateway and it should work again in Wi-Fi AP Mode.
