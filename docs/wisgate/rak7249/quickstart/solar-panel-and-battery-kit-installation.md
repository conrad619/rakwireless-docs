## Installation Guide

1. Install the bolts in the holes which are circled in red in the following image below. This will make an "**H-shaped**" base, for the Solar Panel to be mountable on the top. The circular pipe in the middle of the shape is meant to fit over a circular shaped pole, so the whole construction sits on top with the panel facing upwards on an angle.

:::tip üìù NOTE
 Tighten the nuts and make sure that the rails that make up the base are holding tight against each other.

2. Mount the battery on top of the two parallel rails in the middle. Make sure it is as close as possible to the middle of the construction. Fasten it to the rails with four bolts, each having a washer and a nut. Refer to the image below on how to insert the bolts into the railing that is part of the bottom of the battery casing.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Tighten the bolts as possible as the battery is quite heavy.

1. Connect input port power cable of the Lithium Battery to the screw terminals on the back of the Solar Panel. The image below shows the connection on the back of the solar panel.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Make sure to follow the connection in the image below as interchanging the wires would reverse the polarity. Reversing the polarity when connecting the battery is dangerous and may cause fire.

:::tip üìù NOTE
 Your battery life will vary depending on local illumination intensity. For a 50Ah battery and an 80W solar panel, such as the ones used in the kit, the RAK7249 - Macro Outdoor Gateway should function for about 4 days. This is the worst case scenario where there is constant heavy rain and or constant presence of clouds.
:::

:::tip üìù NOTE
 If you live in extreme condition environment that result in operational time significantly less than 4 days, reconsider into increasing the battery capacity and installing a solar panel with greater power output to compensate such issues.
:::

6. Mount the whole installation you have assembled on top of a circular pole. Put the panel facing up and insert the pole in the pipe opening on the bottom of the construction. Make sure the pole is of a sufficiently small diameter to fit with a recommended value of **65 millimeters**. Use **6 pieces of M8-bolts** to fix the bottom to the construction as shown in the image below.
