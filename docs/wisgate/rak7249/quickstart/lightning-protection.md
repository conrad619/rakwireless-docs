# Lightning Protection

In this document, we will be discussing on how to setup your lightning surge protection system whether be your RAK7249 Macro Outdoor Gateway situated outdoor or indoor. Such protection system must be taken into consideration to ensure a fully functional Gateway without interruption or damage from the lightings.

## Outdoor Surge Protection System

### Antenna Grounding

RAKwireless recommends a lightning arrestor to be installed on all the antenna **N-Type
terminals** (**LoRa¬Æ, LTE, Wi-Fi and GPS**). It is recommended to use a **10-AWG or better
grounding wire** to connect the arrestor to the tower mounted LoRa¬Æ antenna. The arrestors
have to be Female to Male type in order to fit the antenna and housing connectors. Make
sure you use a 10 AWG or better wire to connect the screw terminals of the arrestors to
the grounding rail mounted on the building wall (grounding bar in case of field deployment
as in the picture).

### Gateway Grounding

Additionally it is recommended to use another 10 AWG or better grounding wire to
connect the screw terminal on the bottom right side of the Gateway casing to the
grounding rail (bar).

:::tip üìù NOTE
No additional protection for the Ethernet cabling is required at the Gateway side. There is a surge protection system built-in (GDT + Anti-surge resistor).
:::

## Indoor Surge Protection

For the purpose of protecting the indoor equipment and circuitry connected to the Gateway you need to install an **Ethernet port SPD lightning arrester**. It should be positioned along the cabling connecting the Gateway to the PoE injector. Make sure you connect its grounding wire terminal to an appropriate building grounding point. Thus your PoE injector and network switch/router should be surge protected. Please refer to the images in the diagram below for the Outdoor and Indoor portion of the surge protection system. Should you fail to adhere to the recommendations in this document RAKwireless carries no responsibility for any damage your equipment incurs due to lightning strike!

## Recommended Equipment

### Lightning Arrestor for the LoRa¬Æ, LTE, and Wi-Fi antennas

This lightning arrestor connects between antenna and GPS receiver. A surge protection device for securing transceiver against transients, over-voltage, and surge currents induced by bolts of lightning.

For the purpose of protecting the indoor equipment and circuitry connected to the gateway, you need to install an Ethernet port SPD lightning arrestor.

By adopting a high pass filter, this product can effectively suppress the low-frequency interference induced by lightning while letting through the GPS signal with low insertion loss. A transient suppression device (TVS) and a gas discharge tube (GDT) is adopted for the protection of the DC feed circuit.

### Antenna Feeder Line
