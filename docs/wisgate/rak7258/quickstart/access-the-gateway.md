## WAN Port DHCP IP

When DHCP Server is in the network where the gateway WAN interface is located, the WAN interface can automatically get the IP address. After inquiring the IP address of the gateway through DHCP Server, the WEB management platform of the gateway can be accessed through the DHCP IP address of WAN interface. Same as with the Wi-Fi AP mode, the same IP Address: `192.168.230.1` shall be used to access the **Web Management Platform**.
