## Connect through Wi-Fi

Go into the **Network>Wi-Fi Menu** and make sure to enable the **Wireless Client** as it is disabled initially. Enter or click "**Scan**" to choose your **ESSSID**, select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.

:::tip 📝 NOTE:
 Assuming you have entered the correct parameter values you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (same way as in AP mode).

## Connect through Ethernet/PoE

Connect the **Ethernet Port (ETH)** of the RAK7258 Micro Gateway via an Ethernet cable to your **Router**. The router’s DHCP server should assign an IP Address to the Gateway. You can change the default settings below if you wish (details in the User Manual).
