## Product Background

The **RAK7258 Micro Gateway** is a full 8-channel Gateway with built-in Ethernet connectivity for a straightforward setup. Additionally, there is an on-board Wi-Fi setup that allows it to be easily configured via the default Wi-Fi AP mode.

As with the other RAKwireless Industrial Gateways, it also supports MQTT Bridge mode, with the option for TLS authentication.

Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) is supported to serve cases where wall or ceiling mounting is required without the need to install additional power lines.

The open source software for the management and configuration of this gateway device is based on OpenWRT. It has a built-in LoRa速 packet forwarder and a graphical user interface, allowing for a quick set-up without giving up the freedom of a fully customized solution.

The Gateway has Line-of-Sight (LoS) ranges of up to **15 kilometers**, while for highly urbanized environments it can cover more than **2 kilometers**. It is a perfect solution for any LoRaWAN速 use case scenario.

The RAK Micro Gateway package includes a LoRa速 antenna, mounting screws, and anchors. It is a full 8-channel Gateway with built-in Ethernet connectivity for a straightforward.
