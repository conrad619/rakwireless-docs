# Connecting to the Things Network (TTN)

The Things Network is about enabling low power devices to use long range gateways to connect to an open-source, decentralized network to exchange data with Application. Learn more about the Things Network [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

* First, you should have connected your Gateway to the router in order to access the internet according to the method which has been introduced in the [Accessing the Internet](accessing-your-gateway/accessing-the-internet.html#accessing-the-internet) document.
* Second, config your Gateway and choose TTN as the LoRa¬Æ Server and choose a correct frequency according to the method which has been introduced in the [Configuring the Gateway](configuring-the-gateway.html#server-is-ttn) document.
* Now go to the [TTN Website](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and Login. You will then see the following page:

* Choose Console then Click Gateways.

<rk-img :params="$page.frontmatter.params.img2" />

* All of your Registered Gateways will be displayed here in this page. Click "**register gateway**"

<rk-img :params="$page.frontmatter.params.img3" />

<rk-img :params="$page.frontmatter.params.img4" />

* **Gateway EUI** - refers to the Gatway ID you obtained from the previous steps. In case you forgot, just type `gateway-version` in the command line. This must be the same with the Gateway's True Gateway ID otherwise you will fail to register your Gateway on TTN.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 Make sure to select the "**I'm using the legacy packet forwarder**" check box.
:::

* **Description** - A human readable description of your Gateway.
* **Frequency Plan** - This is the frequency you want to use and it must be the same with Gateway and the Node.
* **Router** - The router this gateway will connect to. To reduce latency, pick a router that is in a region which is close to the location of the gateway.
* **Location** - Choose the location of the Gateway by entering its coordinates. This is reflected on the Gateway World Map.
* **Antenna Placement** - Where is your antenna placed? Is it placed indoors or outdoors?

Click Register Gateway and wait for a couple of minutes . If the status of your gateway is **Connected**, Congratulations! :tada: Your Gateway is now connected to the The Things Network (TTN).
