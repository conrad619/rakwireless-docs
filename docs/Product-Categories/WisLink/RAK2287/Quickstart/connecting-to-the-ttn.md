# Connecting to The Things Network (TTN)

The Things Network is about enabling low power devices to use long range gateways to connect to an open-source, decentralized network to exchange data with Application. Learn more about the Things Network [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/).

- First, you should have connected your  gateway to the router in order to access the internet according to the method which has been introduced in the [auto$](/rak2287-concentrator-module-wislink-series/connecting-to-a-network) section of this document.
- Second, config your  gateway and choose TTN as the LoRa¬Æ Server and choose a correct frequency according to the method which has been introduced in the [auto$](/rak2287-concentrator-module-wislink-series/configuring-the-gateway) section.
- Now go to the TTN Website: [https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and Login. You will then see the following page:

- **Gateway EUI** - refers to the Gatway ID you obtained from the previous step. In case you forgot, just type "**gateway-version**" in the command line. This must be the same with the  gateway's True Gateway ID otherwise you will fail to register your  gateway on TTN.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Make sure to select the "**I'm using the legacy packet forwarder**" check box.
:::

- **Description** - A human readable description of your  gateway.
- **Frequency Plan** - This is the frequency you want to use and it must be the same with  gateway and the node.
- **Router** - The router this gateway will connect to. To reduce latency, pick a router that is in a region which is close to the location of the gateway.
- **Location** - Choose the location of the gateway by entering its coordinates. This is reflected on the Gateway World Map.
- **Antenna Placement** - Where is your antenna placed? Is it placed indoors or outdoors?
