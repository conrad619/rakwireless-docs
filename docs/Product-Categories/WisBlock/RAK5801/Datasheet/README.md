# RAK5801 WisBlock WisIO Module Datasheet

## Overview

### Description

The RAK5801 module is part of the WisBlock series that belongs to the WisIO category. This module is designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisCore and a WisBase module. 

The RAK5801 is a **4-20mA current loop extension module** that allows the users to provide IoT solutions to analog sensors with a 4-20mA interface. This module converts the 4-20mA current signal into voltage range supported by the WisCore module (MCU) for further digitalization and data transmission

The RAK5801 module features **two input channels of 4-20mA**. Inside, high precision operation amplified is used, which supports a wide range of operating temperatures for the signal amplification and conversion. 

Also, this module integrates a **12V power supply**, which can be used by users to power the external sensors. The RAK5801 can be connected to a 2-wire or 3-wire or 4-wire types of 4-20mA sensor. The connection of the 4-20mA sensors is done through the fast crimping terminals without the need for special tools, which simplify the installation process on the fields.


### Features

- Supports WisIO interface, and it is compatible with multiple WisCore modules, such as RAK4201.
- **0.005mA** conversion accuracy. 
- Supports low power consumption mode. The module can be powered off by the WisCore module for saving energy during idle periods.
- Supports 12V output to provide power to external sensors. 
- Reserved **I2C** expansion interface.
- Supports in the field fast crimping terminals.
- Designed with **2kV ESD** protection level.

## Specifications

### Overview


The overview discusses the block diagram of the board. It also shows the installation mechanism on how to mount the board into the baseboard.


#### Block Diagram

The RAK5801 module was designed to convert 4-20mA current signals into voltage signals by applying a resistor. As shown in Figure 1, this voltage signal is conditioned with an operational amplifier to the level supported by an analog input of an MCU. Inside of the MCU, the analog signal is then digitalized by an ADC.

Once the signal is digitalized, you can recover the original current value by applying the following relation: 

``I = U/149``

Where:
- I = Original Current
- U = ADC Reading
- Unit: mA

#### Installation

##### Mounting Mechanism

The RAK5801 module is part of the WisIO category, which connects to the baseboard through the WisIO slot. To install the module, execute the following steps:

1.Keep the RAK5801 module **parallel to the baseboard**. Gently place its WisConnector and plug it into the WisIO slot receptacle of the baseboard. The WisIO slot has an outer silkscreen on it to assist the alignment. At this point, apply force evenly along with the module and press again. There will be a sound to confirm the successful completion of the attachment process.

##### Sensor Connector Crimping Mechanism

The RAK5801 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The crimping terminal can support cable with a width between **24AWG** and **20 AWG**. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7 mm. 

Execute the following steps of the crimping process:

1.Press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly. 

2.Insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connector‚Äôs hole. Once inserted correctly, release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.

## WisBlock Compatability


Since a WisBlock module can be combined with a variety of different functional modules, the pin functions of the MCU are multiplexed, so the interface expansion module for each specific function may need to be appropriately adapted for the WisBlock shipped according to standards. The adaptable modules of RAK5801 are as shown in the following table:

| **WisBlock Module** | **Adaptable Module** | **Description** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| WisBase Baseboard | RAK5005/RAK5005-O | RAK5801 can be attached in the WisIO slot of RAK5005/RAK5005-O baseboard. | 
| WisCore Module | RAK4631 | RAK5801 is compatible with RAK4631. | 
|  | RAK4201 | Low Band: **RAK4201L-ADC**<br>High Band: **RAK4201H-ADC** | 
|  | RAK4202 | Refer to Note 1 for the hardware adaptions to the RAK5005 and RAK4202 shipped according to standards. | 
|  | RAK4261 | Refer to Note 2 for the hardware adaptations to the RAK5005 and RAK4262 shipped according to standards. |
