## Product Description

The **RAK4631 WisBlock** module is part of the WisBlock series, specifically itâ€™s one of the modules that belongs to the WisCore category. 

The RAK4631 is a breakout module designed to work with RAK5005 base board. Essentially, it is a RAK4630 stamp module with an expansion PCB and connectors compatible with the RAK5005 base board. It allows an easy way to access to the pins of the RAK4630 module in order to simplify development and testing processes.

The module itself comprises a RAK4630 as its main component. The RAK4630 is a combination of a nRF52840 MCU and a SX1262 LoRa**Â®** chip, it features an ultra-low power consumption of 2.0uA during sleep mode, high LoRa**Â®** output power up to 22dBm during transmission mode, and the BLE interface with output power up to 4dBm.

The module complies with LoRaWANÂ® 1.0.2 protocols, it also supports LoRaÂ® point to point communication.

The RF communication characteristic of the module (LoraÂ® + BLE) make it suitable for a variety of applications in the IoT field such as home automation, sensor networks, building automation, personal area networks applications (health/fitness sensors and monitors, etc.).
