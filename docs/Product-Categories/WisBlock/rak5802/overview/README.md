# RAK5802 WisBlock WisIO Module

## Product Description

The RAK5802 module is part of the WisBlock series, specifically, it is one of the modules that belongs to the WisIO category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way, and must be combined with a WisCore and a WisBase module.

The RAK5802 is a RS485 ModBus extension module that allows users to provide IoT connectivity to a new/existing solution with RS485 interface. This module converts the RS485 signals into UART signals. These signals are collected by a MCU located inside of a WisCore module for further data transmission. 

The RAK5802 module features one RS485 interface. Inside, a protection circuity is added to protect against ESD hazard. The RAK5802 module complies with the IEC61000-4-2 standard and can protect up to 18 KV HBM ESD.

In addition, the RAK5802 supports one I2C interface, customer can use this I2C interface to connect external sensors.
