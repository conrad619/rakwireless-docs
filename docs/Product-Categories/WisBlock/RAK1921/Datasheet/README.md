# RAK1921 WisBlock WisIO Module Datasheet


### Product Description

The RAK1921 module is part of the WisBlock series that belongs to the accessory category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way. As part of the accessory category, it is not mandatory to be part of a final solution, but on a certain occasion, it provides competitive advantages and improves the usability of the final solution.

RAK1921 is an OLED display module with a **128√ó64 dot matrix**. The main characteristics of this module are the following:

- High Brightness
- Self-emission
- High Contrast Ratio
- Slim/thin Outline
- Wide Viewing Angle
- Wide Temperature Range
- Low Power Consumption

### Product Features

- Display Color: **White**
- Dot Matrix: **128√ó64**
- Driver IC: **SSD1306**
- Interface: **IIC**
- Wide range of operating temperature: **-30¬∞‚Äì70¬∞ C**
- Compatible RAK5005-O header interface

## Specifications

### Hardware

The hardware specification is categorized into four parts. It discusses the interfacing, pinouts, and its corresponding functions and diagrams. It also covers the electrical and mechanical parameters that include the tabular data of the functionalities and standard values of the RAK1921 WisBlock WisIO Module.


#### Interfaces

The RAK1921 module is compatible with the RAK5005-O WisBoard baseboard. The RAK5005-O has reserved a dedicated I2C port with a 2.54 mm header, as shown in Figure 1 highlighted in a red rectangle, in which the RAK1921 can be attached to.
