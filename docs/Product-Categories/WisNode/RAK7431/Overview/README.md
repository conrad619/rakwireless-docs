## Product Description

RAK7431 WisNode Bridge is an RS485 to LoRaWANÂ® converter designed for industrial applications. The device relays ModBUS data using the LoRaWANÂ® network as means of wirelessly transmitting to and from the end devices.

RAK7431 can operate in all of the LoRaWANÂ® bands within the standard parameters defined by the LoRaÂ® Alliance. Its open environment range is 15+ km and in industrial cases, where there are heavy obstructions in the path of the RF signal performance is improved compared to conventional wireless systems due to the characteristics of LoRaÂ® as a modulation technique. This allows for consistently good signal quality within the confines of large factories, densely populated offices, storehouses, etc.

This RS485 compatible devices can address up to 16 client terminal nodes. The conversion from and to LoRaÂ® frames is seamless and allows for real time control and monitoring of multiple RS485 devices, bus data to access and control the RS485 terminal nodes.

RAK7431 together with RAK gateway and LoRaÂ® Server products, can easily and quickly build a wireless industrial field control system. It adopts industrial protection design, supports wide range voltage supply, supports wall mounting and DIN rail installation, facilitates field installation and use.
