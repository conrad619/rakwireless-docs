# Application Demonstration

In this section, you will learn the three different open source application demo of the RAK815 Hybrid Location Tracker. 

## Log Information

After you finish downloading the application, you can view the Log Information through the serial port defined by the firmware. But first, you need to connect **Pin3 >> Pin5, Pin4 >> Pin6** on the UART switch Interface. Refer to the [RAK815 Hybrid Location Tracker Datasheet](https://doc.rakwireless.com/datasheet/rakproducts/rak815-hybrid-location-tracker-datasheet) for proper reference.

:::tip üìù NOTE
The serial program used in this demonstration is CommUart Assistant, although you may use other serial terminals.
:::

### See Log Information

After successfully installing the driver, connect the device to the PC via the Micro
USB connector. Then reset (reset Button is defined as SW3) device will see the following
log information in the serial port.

## LoRaWAN¬Æ Demo

* Turn on your RAK815 and download the LoRaWAN¬Æ Demonstration. 
* Navigate to the Bluetooth settings of your mobile phone and check for "RAK815 LPWAN Demo".

* Open the app and connect to the device's Bluetooth radio "**RAK813
LPWAN Demo**". Then, click RX Characteristic to
send data.

### Parameters using LoRaWAN¬Æ Demo

The LoRaWAN¬Æ web server provider selected use for this case is The Things Network (TTN). To know more about setting up your LoRa¬Æ Gateway device, refer to this **[page](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/labs/story/rak831-lora-gateway-from-package-to-online).**

* After getting OTAA or ABP parameters of device from TTN, you can write data into the flash of RAK815 by transmitting data
through Bluetooth. The format of the data you are sending must be as shown below:

```
lora_cfg:dev_eui=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&app_eui=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&app_key=xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&dev_addr=xxxxxxxx&nwkskey=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx&appskey=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

:::tip üìù NOTE
Because the information is too long, the serial port won't show the details of the configuration.
:::

* After successfully configuring your device parameters, a message will be shown in your serial port saying: "**LoRaWAN**¬Æ **parameters configured successfully**".

* Then, **Reset** the device. If your gateway device is ready, RAK815 will send a join request to LoRaWAN¬Æ network server. You can see the successful information in the terminal.

* You can also see the data sent by the device on the TTN:

## Peripherals Demo

* **Download** the Peripherals Demo into your RAK815.
* Navigate to the Bluetooth settings of your mobile phone and check for **"RAK815 Peripherals Demo"**. 
* The device's log information serial port will print the device's sensor information every five
seconds.

  figure-number="9"
  caption="Device Information Status"

* Similarly with the LoRaWAN¬Æ Demo, you can also send message through the nRF Connect app you installed. The message can be viewed to our serial terminal as shown in the image below.

* If you connect the LCD to the LCD's expansion interface, you can also see the data
for each sensor on the LCD display.

## Scan Demo

* Download the Scan Demo into your RAK815.
* Navigate to the Bluetooth settings of your mobile phone and check for **"RAK815 Scan Demo"**. 
* Same with the previous application, open the nRF Connect app and connect to the Bluetooth named "RAK815 Scan Demo"; configure the device by sending the LoRaWAN¬Æ parameters. The configuration status can be seen in the serial port as shown in the figure below. 

<rk-img
  :src="`${$frontmatter.static_root}/lorawan-status2.jpg`"
  width="100%"
  figure-number="12"
  caption="LoRaWAN¬Æ Parameters Configuration Status"
/>

* After successfully configuring the parameters, check if your gateway has been set in advance. Reset the device and a message will be sent to your terminal that the device has successfully joined in OTAA. 

<rk-img
  :src="`${$frontmatter.static_root}/otaa-activation.jpg`"
  width="100%"
  figure-number="13"
  caption="OTAA Activation Message"
/>

* Next, if you press the first button of the device, see the figure below. The device will
scan the surrounding Bluetooth device for 1s. 

:::tip üìù NOTE
This device can only scan Bluetooth BLE devices.

* If the device scans a Bluetooth BLE device, the scanned device information is printed
out from the log information serial port.

* If your device is in a LoRaWAN¬Æ connection state, at this point your device will send
the Bluetooth BLE device information you scanned to the LoRaWAN¬Æ server.

* In addition, if you connect the LCD to the device LCD expansion interface, you can
view the real-time status of the device on the LCD
