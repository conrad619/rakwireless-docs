# LoRa® P2P Mode

In this section, I’ll show how to use LoRa® P2P mode. We will be using EU868 as our frequency, although it is applicable to other standard bands.

1. First, find two **RAK5205 LoRa® Tracker** which can work on EU868 frequency and make sure their firmware version isn’t less than **V3.0.0.1**.

2. Next, connect these two RAK5205 LoRa® Tracker with PC through UART, and open two serial port tool on PC.

3. Now, configure them to both work in LoRaP2P mode as follow:

```bash
at+set_config=lora:work_mode:1
```

  width="60%"
  figure-number="1"

/>

4. Then configure LoRaP2P parameters for both of them as follow for example:

```bash
at+set_config=lorap2p:869525000:7:0:1:5:5
```

  figure-number="2"

5. OK! Try to send a message from LoRa® Breakout Module 2 (the right one) to LoRa® Breakout Module 1 (the left one):

```bash
at+send=lorap2p:1234567890
```

<rk-img
  :src="`${$frontmatter.static_root}/khjhkisjuxtjb5oxps94.png`"
  width="100%"
  figure-number="3"
  caption="Message sent and received status in the two Nodes"
/>

6. Successfully! Now, send more messages.

```bash
at+send=lorap2p:12345678901234567890
```

/>

Yehey! You have successfully finished your RAK5205 LPWAN Tracker Set Up. You are now ready to develop the coolest project that could potentially change the world.
