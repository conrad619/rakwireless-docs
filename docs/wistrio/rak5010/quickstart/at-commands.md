| `at+get_config=device:status` | Get all information about the device’s hardware components and their current status. | 
| `at+set_config=device:sleep:X` | After set, the device will go to sleep or wake up immediately. <br>• 0 - sleep • 1 - wake up | 
| `at+set_config=device:gps:X` |**• X** - 0: close, 1: open, 2: sleep, 3: standby | 
| `at+set_config=device:cellular:X` | **• X** - 0: close, 1: open | 
| `at+set_config=cellular:send_interval:X:Y` | Set the interval of sending packet loop. <br>**• X** - 0: off, 1: on. <br>**• Y** - the interval time (ms) This value must be more than 150000 (150s). If the X is set to 1, it means that the device will sleep for Y ms after sending a packet automatically in a loop, until you set X to 0. | 
| `at+scan=cellular` | Scan the around Cellular networks | 
| `at+set_config=cellular:XXX:Y:ZZZ:AAA:BBB:C` | Set the IP address and port which you want to send data to through Cellular. <br>**• XXX** - The IP address you want to send data to. <br>**• Y** - The port you want to send data to. <br>**• ZZZ** - The cellular operator’s long name you want to connect, for example: CHINA MOBILE. • AAA - The short name of the Cellular operator, for example: CMCC. <br>**• BBB** - The operator’s APN name, for example CMNET. <br>**• C** - The number of the Cellular network type. For example, 0 indicates GSM, 8 indicates LTE cat.M1, and 9 indicates LTE cat.NB1. |
