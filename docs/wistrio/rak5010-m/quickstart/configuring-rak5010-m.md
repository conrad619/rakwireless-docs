# Configuring the RAK5010-M WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker

You can configure your RAK5010-M WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker by sending AT Commands either through UART or through Micro USB.



:::tip üìù NOTE:
For the full list of AT Commands available for configuring your RAK5010-M, check [AT Commands for RAK5010-M WisTrio NB-IoT Tracker](/wistrio/rak5010-m/quickstart/at-commands.html).
:::



### Through Micro USB

- To begin with, connect your RAK5010-M with your PC through microUSB/USB as shown in the image below:

- Open the serial port tool in your PC.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Any serial tool will work, but it is recommended to use the [**RAK Serial Port Tool**](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).
:::


- Configure the serial communication tool by selecting the proper port of the computer and configure the link as: 115200 bauds, 8 bits, No parity bit and 1 stop bit.
- After pushing the RST button on RAK5010-M, you can see the following contents in the serial port tool, shown in the Figure 2.
