# RAK1921 OLED Display Module 

# Overview

### Product Description

The RAK1921 module is part of the WisBlock series that belongs to the accessory category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way. As part of the accessory category, it is not mandatory to be part of a final solution, but on a certain occasion, it provides competitive advantages and improves the usability of the final solution.

RAK1921 is an OLED display module with a **128√ó64 dot matrix**. The main characteristics of this module are the following:

- High Brightness
- Self-emission
- High Contrast Ratio
- Slim/thin Outline
- Wide Viewing Angle
- Wide Temperature Range
- Low Power Consumption

### Product Features

- Display Color: **White**
- Dot Matrix: **128√ó64**
- Driver IC: **SSD1306**
- Interface: **IIC**
- Wide range of operating temperature: **-30¬∞‚Äì70¬∞ C**
- Compatible RAK5005-O header interface

## Hardware

### Interfaces

The RAK1921 module is compatible with the RAK5005-O WisBoard baseboard. The RAK5005-O has reserved a dedicated I2C port with a 2.54 mm header, as shown in Figure 1 highlighted in a red rectangle, in which the RAK1921 can be attached to.
